= TeiRails

TeiRails is a Ruby on Rails content management system for documents
encoded in the TEI format.  It is not a general purpose editor, but it
does all for users to insert special "litglosses," which are
context-sensitive notes or images, without any knowledge of the TEI format.

It has features associated with many content management systems (and
some which are more advanced than many existing systems) including
support for versioning of documents and a document workflow that
supports "cloning" of documents into a private workspace.
