	Michel Foucault (October 15, 1926–June 25, 1984) was a French
	philosopher, historian, critic and sociologist. He held a
	chair at the Collège de France, giving it the title "History
	of Systems of Thought," and taught at the University of
	California, Berkeley.

	Michel Foucault is best known for his critical studies of
	various social institutions, most notably psychiatry,
	medicine, the human sciences, and the prison system, as well
	as for his work on the history of human sexuality. Foucault's
	work on power, and the relationships among power, knowledge,
	and discourse, has been widely discussed and
	applied. Sometimes described as postmodernist or
	post-structuralist, in the 1960s he was more often associated
	with the structuralist movement. Foucault later distanced
	himself from structuralism and always rejected the
	post-structuralist and postmodernist labels.
