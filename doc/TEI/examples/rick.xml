	<l>TWO roads diverged in a yellow wood, </l>
	<l>And sorry I could not travel both </l>
	<l>And be one traveler, long I stood </l>
	<l>And looked down one as far as I could </l>
	<l>To where it bent in the undergrowth; </l>
      <l>Then took the other, as just as fair, </l></lg>
      <lg>
	<l>And having perhaps the better claim, </l>
	<l>Because it was grassy and wanted wear; </l>
	<l>Though as for that the passing there </l>
      <l>Had worn them really about the same, </l></lg>
      <lg>
	<l>And both that morning equally lay </l>
	<l>In leaves no step had trodden black. </l>
	<l>Oh, I kept the first for another day! </l>
	<l>Yet knowing how way leads on to way, </l>
      <l>I doubted if I should ever come back. </l></lg>
      <lg>
	<l>I shall be telling this with a sigh </l>
	<l>Somewhere ages and ages hence: </l>
	<l>Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€” </l>
	<l>I took the one less traveled by, </l>
      <l>And that has made all the difference. </l></lg>
