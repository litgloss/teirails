	<head>Introduction</head>
	<p>
	  TEI Rails is a content management system, writting in Ruby
	  on Rails, for documents encoded in TEI. Development funding
	  for the project came from a grant from the National
	  Endowment for the Humanities at the <ref
	  target="http://www.buffalo.edu"> University at
	  Buffalo</ref>.  The content management system is intended to
	  run the <ref target="http://litgloss.buffalo.edu">Litgloss
	  archive</ref>, which is a collection of texts in a variety
	  of languages featuring pedagogically-useful annotations.
	</p>
      </div>

      <div n="Features">
	<head>Features</head>

	<p>
	  TEI Rails has a number of features which make storing and
	  collaborating on documents encoded in TEI easier.  These
	  features include support for document versioning, media file
	  storage with associated documents, a workflow which
	  facilitates collaboration, and advanced features for
	  document annotation.
	</p>



	<div n="Versioning">
	  <head>Document Versioning</head>

	  <p>
	    TEI Rails, by default, stores all versions created of a
	    particular document.  At any time, authorized users may view
	    or revert to any one of the previous versions of a content
	    item.
	  </p>

	</div>

	<div n="Workflow">
	  <head>Document Workflow</head>

	  <p>
	    The system also supports a hierarchy of users and workflow
	    for collaboration.  Without customization, the default
	    hierarchy allows for classes of users considered to be
	    system administrators, editors, contributors, and normal
	    users.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    TEI Rails allows for users to collaborate on documents by
	    creating private "clones" of those documents.  A clone is
	    basically a shallow copy of a document into a private
	    workspace of a user.  Once a user and editor are satisfied
	    with her changes, an editor may pull from these local
	    changes and modify the public content item.  This approach
	    to document workflow, which allows for "clusters" of
	    document clones around a central document object, allows
	    for security while also providing a "sandbox" where users
	    less familiar with TEI may try their changes safely.
	  </p>

	</div>

	<div n="Annotation">
	  <head>Annotation</head>

	<p>
	  TEI Rails features a variety of different forms of
	  "annotation".  Since the native document format is TEI Lite
	  (P5), annotations may be manually inserted into a document
	  in a form following the TEI guidelines for version P5 and
	  the TEI Lite DTD.  In addition to this, TEI Rails includes a
	  web-based editor allowing users without specific knowledge
	  of XML or TEI to insert textual or graphical annotations of
	  words or phrases in a document text.
	</p>

	<p>
	  TEI Rails also includes an Annotea server, which allows for
	  collaboration on documents through XPointer references to
	  any rendered document in the TEI Rails system.  This Annotea
	  server was written as a Ruby on Rails plugin, and is shipped
	  by default with TEI Rails installations.  It is also
	  available by itself for simple inclusion in other Ruby on
	  Rails applications.
	</p>

	</div>

	<div n="Media">
	  <head>Media Files</head>
	<p>
	  TEI Rails helps to associate media files with TEI documents.
	  It allows for images and audio files to be associated with a
	  TEI content item or with annotations made with the web-based
	  annotation editor.  Facilities are provided so that users may
	  upload media files via web forms.
	</p>

	</div>


	<div n="ValidXML">
	  <head>XML Validation</head>
	  <p>
	    TEI Rails checks all input against a DTD for TEI Lite, and
	    it passes errors from the validator to the user.  No data
	    are saved in the system if a document is not well-formed and
	    able to be validated against a DTD.
	  </p>
