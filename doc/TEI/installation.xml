	  Installing TEI Rails involves identifying and resolving
	  dependencies on your system, downloading the source code,
	  and deciding on and implementing a deployment strategy.
	  This document will walk you through these steps.

	<p>
	  TEI Rails has a number of dependencies.  As there is still
	  no method built-in of identifying and resolving these, the
	  easiest way to prepare your system is to install the
	  programs and libraries below before downloading and
	  attempting to run the source code.
	</p>

	<p>First, TEI Rails has only been tested on Linux, and there
	has been no attempt to port it to other platforms.  On your linux system,
	then, make sure that you have the following programs installed:
	</p>

	<list type="ordered">
	  <item>
	    Libxml2 and libxslt must be installed.  The binary for xsltproc should be 
	    somewhere in your path, but if you have installed libxml2 and xsltproc this should
	    already be done for you.
